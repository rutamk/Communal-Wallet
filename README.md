Communal Wallet: Debt Settlement Algorithm ðŸ’¸

Overview
The Communal Wallet algorithm simplifies debt transactions among a group of people by addressing the largest debts and credits first. The aim is to minimize the number of transactions needed to settle all debts efficiently.

Scenario
Imagine a group of friends who have shared expenses, resulting in the following balances:

Aarav: -â‚¹5 (owes â‚¹5) ðŸ’°
Bhavna: â‚¹25 (is owed â‚¹25) ðŸ’µ
Chaitanya: -â‚¹20 (owes â‚¹20) ðŸ’°
Devika: â‚¹25 (is owed â‚¹25) ðŸ’µ
Esha: -â‚¹20 (owes â‚¹20) ðŸ’°
Farhan: -â‚¹5 (owes â‚¹5) ðŸ’°
Using this algorithm, we simplify their transactions by directly settling the largest amounts.

Steps
Calculate Net Amounts:

Each person's net balance is provided:
Positive Balance: Person is owed money. ðŸ’µ
Negative Balance: Person owes money. ðŸ’°
Identify Debtors and Creditors:

Largest Debtor: Esha and Chaitanya (both owe â‚¹20, which is the maximum debt). ðŸ’°
Largest Creditor: Bhavna and Devika (both are owed â‚¹25, which is the maximum credit). ðŸ’µ
Settle Debts:

Step 1: Esha (largest debtor) should pay Devika (largest creditor). Esha owes â‚¹20 and Devika is owed â‚¹25. Transfer â‚¹20 from Esha to Devika.

Updated Balances:
Esha: -â‚¹0 (debt settled) âœ…
Devika: â‚¹5 (remaining credit) ðŸ’µ
Step 2: Chaitanya (next largest debtor) should pay Bhavna (next largest creditor). Chaitanya owes â‚¹20 and Bhavna is owed â‚¹25. Transfer â‚¹20 from Chaitanya to Bhavna.

Updated Balances:
Chaitanya: -â‚¹0 (debt settled) âœ…
Bhavna: â‚¹5 (remaining credit) ðŸ’µ
Step 3: Handle the remaining balances:

Aarav: -â‚¹5 (owes â‚¹5) ðŸ’°
Farhan: -â‚¹5 (owes â‚¹5) ðŸ’°
Bhavna and Devika have remaining credits of â‚¹5 each. ðŸ’µ
Aarav can pay Bhavna â‚¹5, and Farhan can pay Devika â‚¹5.

Final Balances:

Aarav: â‚¹0 (debt settled) âœ…
Farhan: â‚¹0 (debt settled) âœ…
Bhavna: â‚¹0 (credit settled) âœ…
Devika: â‚¹0 (credit settled) âœ…
Update Balances:

Adjust the balances after each settlement and remove anyone whose balance becomes zero from further consideration.
Repeat:

Continue this process with updated balances until all debts are settled or only one person remains with a non-zero balance.
Conclusion
By following the Communal Wallet algorithm, you ensure that debts are settled efficiently, minimizing the number of transactions and simplifying the settlement process for everyone involved. ðŸŽ‰

# How to Use?  
  
I have created a method which just do it.  
   **"findPath(parm)"**  
    
**Create a HashMap Variable**  
  "static HashMap parm = new HashMap()"  
  
**Add the Expense in below formate**  

 Â  Â  Â  "parm.put("Name", Amount)"  
  
  For Example,  
  
        parm.put("Aarav", -5.0);  // Aarav owes â‚¹5
        parm.put("Bhavna", 25.0); // Bhavna is owed â‚¹25
        parm.put("Chaitanya", -20.0); // Chaitanya owes â‚¹20
        parm.put("Devika", 25.0); // Devika is owed â‚¹25
        parm.put("Esha", -20.0); // Esha owes â‚¹20
        parm.put("Farhan", -5.0); // Farhan owes â‚¹5

**Passing values to find the Net Amount to be Paid with Person Name -Cash Flow / Shortest Path**  
      
      findPath(parm);  
      
**Output**  
Chaitanya needs to pay Bhavna: â‚¹20.0
Esha needs to pay Devika: â‚¹20.0
Farhan needs to pay Bhavna: â‚¹5.0
Aarav needs to pay Devika: â‚¹5.0
